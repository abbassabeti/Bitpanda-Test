## Depedencies

To find out more about how to run the app, see Installation instructions below.

## Installation

To run the app, you need to clone it and then, use below command in the root folder of project

```ruby
pod install
```

And Finally, run the app. As it can be seen from the above screenshots, there are 3 different bottom tabs in the app:


 - Asset

 - Wallet
 
 - Overall
    
The last one is a suggestion of different grouped way of showing all Assets in a single Screen and Another screen for showing wallets in their corresponding groups. In all Tabs the default wallets are shown with a  different color for image border and font. Also, in overall Tabs, different types of Assets and Wallets are grouped using section headers. You can also apply filters on each list with just tapping the blue button at the bottom of pages and select one the filters.
